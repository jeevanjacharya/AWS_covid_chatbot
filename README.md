# CHATBOT FOR COVID-19 ASSESSMENT!

 The aim of this project is to build a text based and voice based data driven web-based application employing multiple AWS services that can be used to perform COVID-19 assessment of a person by gathering their basic information and advice them to consult a doctor if the bot provides the assessment results as Positive otherwise mention they are safe if the result is received as Negative.

 Through this project, we are presenting a chatbot application that uses the features and services of the AWS platform to help people assess their body health condition themselves on their fingertips so that if infected the person will be prompted to immediately consult a COVID-19 specialist based on his/her symptoms mentioned by the user during the conversation with the chatbot. Based on its advantages of taking the assessment from anywhere and at anytime such applications are considered to have great potential in the future.
